	"what": "The Good Governance Index tells us how Puget Sound residents perceive the way decisions are made regarding management and use of the natural environment. The index is made up of 5 different indicators. The indicators offer insights for improving our overall decision-making processes, strengthening communication strategies, and strengthening the engagement of our partners and citizenry. An index is appropriate because the indicators are conceptually similar and often correlated.~SL Indicator 1: Opportunity to influence decisions. Percent of residents who feel they have the opportunity to influence environmental decisions if desired.~B Indicator 2: Freedom to make decisions. Percent of residents who feel they have the rights and freedoms to make decisions about how the natural environment is managed.~B Indicator 3: Trust in local and regional government. Percent of residents who trust local and regional government to make the right decisions for protecting and recovering Puget Sound.  ~B Indicator 4: Representation in community and government leaders. Percent of residents who feel represented by community and government leaders.~B Indicator 5: Access to information: Percent of residents who obtain information about natural resource issues from pre-defined sources. ~EL~P Data will be collected every 2 years via survey to Puget Sound residents. Results will be reported as a mean index value. All data will be analyzed for significant differences across demographic groups ",
