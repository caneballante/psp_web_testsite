Recreational activities tracked are limited to those within the scope of Puget Sound recovery and include both passive and active recreational activities, such as wildlife-watching, fishing, bicycling, boating, and swimming. ~P We are not yet collecting data for this indicator, but when we do, data will be collected every 2 years via a survey of Puget Sound residents about their outdoor recreation habits. The results will be reported as the average time Puget Sound residents spend per week engaging in seasonal outdoor recreation activity.  All data will be analyzed for significant differences across demographic groups.",
