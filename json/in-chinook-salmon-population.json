    "progress-description": "There is little sign of recovery of Puget Sound Chinook populations in each biogeographic region, and most populations remain far below their recovery planning targets adopted by the National Marine Fisheries Service. On the other hand, the vast majority of populations have not decreased significantly in abundance over time.~SL Estimates of abundance of the 22 Puget Sound Chinook populations are not changing appreciably. Two populations declined and two increased between the most recent 5-year period (2012-2016) and the baseline reference period (1999-2003). The increases were for the Elwha (Strait of Juan de Fuca region) and Upper Sauk (Whidbey) populations and declines were for the Snoqualmie (Whidbey) and Sammamish (Central/South) populations.~B The 2016 interim targets have not been met.~B In all regions, population abundance has changed very little since the baseline reference period, and these values remain far below their recovery planning targets.~EL ",
	"what": "This indicator is Chinook salmon population abundance as measured by the number of natural origin adult fish returning to spawn.~P Chinook salmon population spawner abundance is reported here as the number of natural-origin fish returning to rivers to spawn naturally, for all populations except for the Skagit River basin. Total spawner abundance is normally estimated each year by counting the number of redds (gravel nests) in a river. Redds are counted by walking the stream and/or from boats or aircraft. In many populations, some hatchery-origin salmon are present on the spawning grounds along with natural-origin salmon, complicating the estimates of natural-origin salmon returns. The proportions of spawners that were of natural versus hatchery origin are typically estimated based on the composition of carcasses. These values are applied to the total spawning population to estimate the number of natural-origin versus hatchery-origin spawners.~P Natural-origin, naturally-spawning abundance data are not currently available for the Suiattle, Cascade, Upper Sauk, Lower Sauk, Upper Skagit, and Lower Skagit populations.  However, the proportion of hatchery-origin, naturally-spawning fish is known to have been consistent since 1999 and low, and so we use the total number of naturally-spawning Chinook salmon in these analyses. We will continue to try to gather natural-origin, naturally-spawning Chinook salmon abundance data from these populations for further analyses.~P In our latest evaluation of abundance change over time, the mean (annual) abundance of spawning Chinook salmon for the 5-year period 2012 – 2016 was compared to the 5-year baseline period 1999 – 2003 (after ESA listing occurred). It should be noted that the 1999-2003 period was one of relatively favorable ocean conditions (i.e., a “cool” PDO phase) for Puget Sound Chinook salmon. If data were not available during these periods for a given population, data from the first or last years with available data were used.",
