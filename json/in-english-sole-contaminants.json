	"target": "By 2020, toxics in fish are below threshold levels. Target is achieved if each of the following conditions is observed in monitoring results from 2019 or 2020:~P a. Bioaccumulative toxics – 95% of samples meet the following thresholds:~P~I i. Concentrations of PCBs and PBDEs in Puget Sound herring, English sole, and salmon and steelhead are below adverse effects thresholds (e.g., 2,400 ng PCB/g lipid and 1,400 ng PBDE/g lipid) ~P~I ii. Concentrations of PCBs and other biocumulative toxics in Puget Sound herring, English sole, and salmon and steelhead are below human health screening levels (e.g., Department of Health screening levels for recreational or subsistence consumption rates, currently 33 ng PCB/g and 10 ng PCB/g fish tissue, respectively for a non-cancer endpoint). ~P b. PAHs and EDCs – all samples meet the following thresholds: ~P~I i. English sole in Puget Sound exhibit no PAH-related liver disease ~P~I ii. English sole in Puget Sound exhibit no toxics-related reproductive impairment ~P~I iii. PAHs in herring are below an effects threshold.",
