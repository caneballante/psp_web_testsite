	"what": "The Psychological Wellbeing Index will help us understand whether Puget Sound residents experience inspiration and stress reduction while in nature. These are critical measures of whether the natural environment contributes to human wellbeing. The Psychological Wellbeing Index is measured by using two survey questions to determine the degree to which engagement with the natural environment contributes to psychological wellbeing. An index is appropriate because each question measures a related, yet unique, aspect of the concept.~P Indicator 2a: Inspiration. Percent of residents who experience inspiration from being in nature~P Indicator 2b: Stress Reduction. Average number of residents who experience reduced stress from being in nature ~P Data will be collected every 2 years via a survey to Puget Sound residents. Results will be reported as a mean index value for Puget Sound residents. The data will be analyzed for significant differences across demographic groups.",
