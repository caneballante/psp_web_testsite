    "progress-description": "~SL Combined employment in natural resource-driven industries in Puget Sound has trended upward from 76,046 jobs in 2005 to 90,982 jobs in 2014, largely impacted by growth in Puget Sound shoreline recreation and tourism.~B Aquaculture, agriculture and recreation and tourism sectors all report general employment growth from 2005 to 2014.~B On average, 4,524 employed or self-employed people reported fishing employment between 2005 and 2014. Fishing employment trend is mixed between 2005 and 2012, but reveals a recent decline of roughly 300 people between 2012 and 2014.~B The timber extraction industry lost employment from 2005 to 2011, but held steady around 1,300 jobs from 2011 to 2014.~B Removing recreation and tourism employment from combined employment reveals mixed estimates. Trends from 2005 to 2014 are likely driven by a combination of pre- and post-recession effects paired with recent below average Puget Sound fishery yields, and declines in timber and agriculture in recent years.~EL",
	"what": "This indicator tells us how many jobs are supported by natural resource industries in Puget Sound. Puget Sound residents have a strong connection to resource-based industries such as fishing, agriculture, aquaculture, timber, and tourism. While we can measure the economic output for these industries, it is also important to monitor how such output relates to the maintenance of job opportunities. Natural resource industries often provide employment to many generations of a family and define a way of life. In addition, employment in these sectors brings individuals in direct contact with the environment, which can foster an ethic of stewardship toward natural resources. ~P This indicator can be used to track changes in the sustainability of employment opportunities in natural resource industries. The data will be compiled from existing sources to provide information on the number of jobs in individual and combined natural resources-based industries in Puget Sound, by county, by year.",

	"why-happening": "~SL Ex vessel value from PACfin confirms slack years in commercial fisheries.  In addition, droughts and low runs of salmon may have led to loss of jobs in this sector between 2012 and 2014. ~B While employment in timber and agriculture sectors has shown moderate declines, output has remained the same or risen.  This trend could be the result of technological advances.~B Increases in employment in tourism and recreation may be attributable to greater consumer demand for farm to table destination dining, cruise ship and tribal casino visitation, accessible shore based recreation (kayaking, stand up paddle boarding, and etc.), and development of tourism infrastructure such as hotels and VRBO accomodations. Some aspects of this increased demand suggest that there is a consumer willingness to pay for the nonmarket attributes of the coastal ecosystem (such as recreation, aesthetics, and culture).~EL",
