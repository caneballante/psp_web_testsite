	"what": "The Local Foods Vital Sign is intended to track the perceived access to Puget Sound wild food resources for traditional, sustenance, and recreational use. These will include four specific categories of foods: fish, shellfish, mushrooms/plants, and animal meat. Data will be collected every 2 years via survey to Puget Sound residents. Results will be reported as the percentage of Puget Sound residents who perceive different levels of access either due to physical access or quality of available foods. The data will be analyzed for significant differences across demographic groups.",
