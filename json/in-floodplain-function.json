	"what": "Floodplain function can be assessed in term of the connectivity and cover of floodplain areas. In general, areas that have native vegetation (forest or wetland) with no constraints (roads, railroads, levees, revetments, or development) separating them from an unregulated river are expected to support most functions or, in the case of timber harvesting, to be recovering those functions. ~P There are three general indicators of the loss of floodplain function:  ~P 1) Land cover change in floodplain areas indicating development or other removal of native vegetation other by river channel migration; ~P 2) New construction of roads or levees on floodplains; ~P 3) Increased flood regulation from new reservoirs, added capacity to existing dams, or changes in reservoir operations that reduce flood frequency or magnitude. Specific indicators of floodplain function require detailed site analysis that is beyond the scope of a region indicator.",
