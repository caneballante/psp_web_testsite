Marine factors related to prey abundance may also play a role in murrelet distribution and trend.~EL",
      "what":"The indicator is the abundance of marine bird populations.~P The marine bird population indicator measures population abundance and trends of a handful of bird species that nest or overwinter in the marine environment. The indicator includes:~P 1. Spring/summer at-sea densities of marbled murrelet, rhinoceros auklet and pigeon guillemot. These species are highly dependent on the marine environment of, and breed in, Puget Sound and Strait of Juan de Fuca.~P 2. At-sea abundance trends of scoter species that overwinter in Puget Sound and Strait of Juan de Fuca. These species are highly dependent on the marine environment of Puget Sound and the Strait of Juan de Fuca, but do not breed there. ~P The species selected for this indicator reside in Puget Sound most, if not all, of the year. The indicator provides an integrative view of the health of species that depend upon the Puget Sound for survival, in contrast to the species being indirect indicators of something like habitat quality, contaminants, or prey. ~P The Washington State Department of Fish and Wildlife conducts marine bird surveys in the spring/summer months and in January for wintering birds. The spring/summer surveys are boat-based and are part of the Northwest Forest Plan effectiveness monitoring program for the Marbled Murrelet (http://www.reo.gov/monitoring/reports/marbled-murrelet-reports-publications.shtml). During these surveys, observers also record other species detected. WDFW also conducts winter surveys from airplanes that allow us to assess abundance and trends of scoters and other over-wintering species (http://wdfw.wa.gov/publications/01135/).~P The marine bird indicator was officially endorsed by the Science Panel at their April 9, 2014 meeting. The endorsement was based on a peer-reviewed report written jointly by the Washington State Department of Fish and Wildlife and the Puget Sound Partnership. The report, titled “Marine and Terrestrial Bird Indicators for Puget Sound, (http://www.psp.wa.gov/vitalsigns/documents/Pearson%20and%20Hamel%20Bird%20Indicators%202013_Final.pdf) develops, presents, and uses a transparent process to identify and evaluate potential indicators and ultimately recommend marine bird indicators.~P The peer-review process was coordinated by the Puget Sound Partnership Science Panel in 2013. The report was finalized in April of 2014. The indicators were also endorsed by the Leadership Council in January 2014.

Ongoing citizen-science monitoring by local Whidbey Island residents from 2008 through 2016 [Provide link: http://pigeonguillemot.org/ ] and South Sound residents [Provide link: http://www.nisquallyestuary.org/research.html] indicates stable local populations. Local population results are consistent with the sound-wide trends in density trends obtained during the spring/summer boat-based surveys.~P The number of adult guillemots in the colonies nesting in the bluffs of Whidbey Island averaged 1,032 ± 33 birds. Occupied burrows, indicated by adults going into the burrow, averaged 244 ± 20 burrows. Burrows with chicks, indicated by prey delivery to the burrow, averaged 160 ± 12.

They spend about eight months of the year, with some non-breeding individuals here year-round. They are foraging, replacing their feathers and putting on weight needed to successfully reproduce in high arctic lakes in the summer. Recently published research by Vilchis et al. (2015) [Provide link: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/cobi.12378/abstract] indicates that over-wintering species were three times more likely to exhibit population declines in the Salish Sea than local breeders; for scoter, between 1994 and 2010, they declined in 9% of the 67 depth/basin strata evaluted. In general, Vilchis et al (2015) found that alcids (species like the marbled murrelet and common murre) and sea ducks (species like the scoters) dominated the over-wintering bird community during the 1990s, whereas non-diving bird species and diving species with diverse diets dominated the wintering bird community in the 2000s."
