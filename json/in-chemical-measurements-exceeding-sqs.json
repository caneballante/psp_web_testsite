    "progress-description": "Although the target is not fully met across all of Puget Sound, recent improvements suggest progress toward the target:~B The percent of individual chemicals exceeding SQS since 1997 is typically small (mostly less than 1 percent) except for Central Sound, Elliott Bay, and Commencement Bay, where the number still never exceeded 6 percent. ~B Even fewer chemicals exceeded state SQS in the second round of sampling, with four regions dropping to zero, now meeting the target value in those areas. ~B Budd Inlet and the Port Gardner/Everett Harbor urban embayments are also at zero.~B Values calculated for the third round of sampling in Bainbridge Basin in 2015 remain unchanged.",
	"what": "This indicator is Sediment Quality Standards.~P This indicator is the percent of individual chemical measurements that exceed the Washington Sediment Quality Standards (SQS), which is related to the Sediment Chemistry Index, another indicator for the marine sediment Vital Sign. ~P SQS values have been determined for a total of 47 chemicals in Puget Sound. Of those, 39 are included in the SCI and evaluated for this indicator.",
