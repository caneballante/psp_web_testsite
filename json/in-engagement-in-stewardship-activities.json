	"what": "This indicator is a measure of the extent to which Puget Sound residents engage in collective environmental stewardship activities. Because of the importance of social connections to sustaining behaviors and overall human wellbeing, it also provides a measure of the degree to which engagement in stewardship activities contributes to wellbeing. The indicator measures community-based, collaborative actions that are intended to improve some aspect of environmental health. Data from this indicator can be used to inform outreach strategies and to identify potential predictors of observed change in environmental health.~P Data will be collected every 2 years via survey to Puget Sound residents. Results will be reported as percent of Puget Sound residents that engage in collaborative environmental stewardship activities, as defined by the respondent. The data will be analyzed for significant differences across demographic groups.",
